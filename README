Crypt::OpenSSL::Common version 0.1
==================================

This module is an XS perl module designed to provide access to the generic 
functionality of the OpenSSL libraries.

It complements the other modules in the Crypt::OpenSSL::* hierarchy in many ways:
providing proper OpenSSL initialization, access to extended error information, etc.

For example:

    use Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA;
    use Crypt::OpenSSL::Common;

    my $private = Crypt::OpenSSL::RSA->new_private_key($pem_encrypted_key);

With out Crypt::OpenSSL::Common, the C::O::RSA's new_private_key method can't
handle encrypted keys. Now it can handle them.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

For proper interoperability, this module must be compiled with the same OpenSSL
libraries used to compile the other Crypt::OpenSSL::* modules.
